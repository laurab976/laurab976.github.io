            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Laura Burke, a first-year Interaction Design student at the University of Limerick.  
               I chose this course because I’ve always been interested in how design impacts the way  
               people engage with technology. From intuitive interfaces to seamless digital experiences,  
               I love exploring ways to make the web more user-friendly and accessible.</p>

            <p>I’m particularly interested in UX/UI design, front-end development, and graphic design.  
               I enjoy experimenting with layouts, typography, and color schemes to create visually  
               appealing designs. I also have experience using Affinity Suite to work on branding  
               and digital graphics.</p>

            <p>Outside of my coursework, I like creating interactive prototypes, exploring new design  
               trends, and refining my web development skills.</p>

            <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <p>I have a strong passion for design that goes beyond aesthetics—I love creating meaningful, accessible digital experiences.  
               I’m particularly interested in UX/UI design and accessibility, ensuring that technology is inclusive and user-friendly for everyone.</p>

            <p>I enjoy exploring emerging trends in web development, experimenting with motion design, and refining my front-end coding skills.  
               My interest in human-computer interaction drives me to design intuitive and engaging digital interfaces that enhance user experiences.</p>

            <h2>Reflection & Future Plans</h2>
            <p>This portfolio represents my current skills, interests, and aspirations in interaction design.  
               Through this project, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of structuring web content, enhancing user experience,  
               and creating visually cohesive designs.</p>

            <p>As I continue to develop my skills, I aim to expand this portfolio by incorporating more interactive elements,  
               refining my design approach, and showcasing future projects.</p>

            <p>In the long term, I hope to specialize in UX/UI design, with a strong focus on accessibility and user-centered experiences.  
               My goal is to continuously improve, experiment with new design techniques, and build digital experiences that are both functional and engaging.</p>

        <section class="design-process container">
            <h2>My Design Process</h2>
            <p>Before building this portfolio, I sketched out a wireframe to structure my content and ensure a user-friendly layout.  
               This helped me visualize how different elements, such as sections, headings, and images, would be arranged.</p>

            <p>I focused on a minimalistic yet engaging design with a sage green color scheme to reflect my style.  
               By using Bootstrap, I ensured that the site is fully responsive, adjusting seamlessly to different screen sizes.</p>

            <p>Below is my initial boxified wireframe sketch, which guided my design choices throughout this project.</p>
